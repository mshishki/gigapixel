\section{Online Resources}

This work is accompanied by a presentation which additionally demonstrates the image formation model of QIS and the following reconstruction. We generate synthetic data in accordance with the methods listed in Section \ref{chapter:imform} using grayscale images, provided by the USC-SIPI Image Database (\url{http://sipi.usc.edu/database/}).

Image reconstruction with variable threshold sizes has been covered by \cite{qisthreshold}, who provide executable MATLAB code on their page: \url{https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/project_QIS.html}. The code is copyrighted by 2017 Statistical Signal and Image Processing Lab, Purdue University, with granted permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for educational, research and non-profit purposes, without fee, and without a written agreement.
