ABSTRACT = {This work fits the measured in-pixel source-follower noise in a CMOS Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) prototype chip using physics-based 1/f noise models, rather than the widely-used fitting model for analog designers. This paper discusses the different origins of 1/f noise in QIS devices and includes correlated double sampling (CDS). The modelling results based on the Hooge mobility fluctuation, which uses one adjustable parameter, match the experimental measurements, including the variation in noise from room temperature to –70 °C. This work provides useful information for the implementation of QIS in scientific applications and suggests that even lower read noise is attainable by further cooling and may be applicable to other CMOS analog circuits and CMOS image sensors.},

abstract = {The resolution of a camera system determines the fidelity of visual features in captured images. Higher resolution implies greater fidelity and, thus, greater accuracy when performing automated vision tasks, such as object detection, recognition, and tracking. However, the resolution of any camera is fundamentally limited by geometric aberrations. In the past, it has generally been accepted that the resolution of lenses with geometric aberrations cannot be increased beyond a certain threshold. We derive an analytic scaling law showing that, for lenses with spherical aberrations, resolution can be increased beyond the aberration limit by applying a postcapture deblurring step. We then show that resolution can be further increased when image priors are introduced. Based on our analysis, we advocate for computational camera designs consisting of a spherical lens shared by several small planar sensors. We show example images captured with a proof-of-concept gigapixel camera, demonstrating that high resolution can be achieved with a compact form factor and low complexity. We conclude with an analysis on the trade-off between performance and complexity for computational imaging systems with spherical lenses.},

abstract="In this paper we present a perceptual and error-based comparison study of the efficacy of four different deep-learned super-resolution architectures, ESPCN, SRResNet, ProGanSR and LapSRN, all performed on photo-realistic images by a factor of 4x; adapting some of the current state-of-the-art architectures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The resultant application and the implemented CNNs are tested with objective (Peak-Signal-to-Noise ratio and Structural Similarity Index) and perceptual metrics (Mean Opinion Score testing), to judge their relative quality and implementation within the program. The results of these tests demonstrate the effectiveness of super-resolution, showing that most network implementations give an average gain of +1 to +2 dB (in PSNR), and an average gain of +0.05 to +0.1 (in SSIM) over traditional Bicubic scaling. The results of the perception test also show that participants almost always prefer the images scaled using each CNN model compared to traditional Bicubic scaling. These findings also present a look into new diverging paths in super-resolution research; where the focus is now shifting from solely error-reduction, objective-based models to perceptually focused models that satisfy human perception of a high-resolution image.",

abstract = {In several emerging fields of study such as encryption in optical communications, determination of the number of photons in an optical pulse is of great importance. Typically, such photon-number-resolving sensors require operation at very low temperature (e.g., 4\&\#x00A0;K for superconducting-based detectors) and are limited to low pixel count (e.g., hundreds). In this paper, a CMOS-based photon-counting image sensor is presented with photon-number-resolving capability that operates at room temperature with resolution of 1 megapixel. Termed a quanta image sensor, the device is implemented in a commercial stacked (3D) backside-illuminated CMOS image sensor process. Without the use of avalanche multiplication, the 1.1\&\#x00A0;\&\#x03BC;m pixel-pitch device achieves 0.21e\&\#x2212;\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;rms average read noise with average dark count rate per pixel less than 0.2e\&\#x2212;/s, and 1040\&\#x00A0;fps readout rate. This novel platform technology fits the needs of high-speed, high-resolution, and accurate photon-counting imaging for scientific, space, security, and low-light imaging as well as a broader range of other applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents a camera comprising 512 × 128 pixels capable of single-photon detection and gating with a maximum frame rate of 156 kfps. The photon capture is performed through a gated single-photon avalanche diode that generates a digital pulse upon photon detection and through a digital one-bit counter. Gray levels are obtained through multiple counting and accumulation, while time-resolved imaging is achieved through a 4-ns gating window controlled with subnanosecond accuracy by a field-programmable gate array. The sensor, which is equipped with microlenses to enhance its effective fill factor, was electro-optically characterized in terms of sensitivity and uniformity. Several examples of capture of fast events are shown to demonstrate the suitability of the approach.},

ABSTRACT = {A new quantum random number generation method is proposed. The method is based on the randomness of the photon emission process and the single photon counting capability of the Quanta Image Sensor (QIS). It has the potential to generate high-quality random numbers with remarkable data output rate. In this paper, the principle of photon statistics and theory of entropy are discussed. Sample data were collected with QIS jot device, and its randomness quality was analyzed. The randomness assessment method and results are discussed.},

For implementation of the single directional infinite scan with high lateral resolution, a parallelogram array micro-objective lens module, composed of two wafer-level microlens arrays, is proposed to generate a massively parallel optical probe array for integration into the confocal imaging system, including an objective-side telecentric relay lens with a low-magnification. To test the feasibility of the proposed system with single directional infinite scanning, we designed and constructed a confocal imaging system using a parallelogram array of multi-optical probes with a massively parallel array size of 200 × 140. The constructed system provides a full width-half maximum lateral resolution of 1.55 μm, as measured by the knife-edge detection method, and a field-of-view width of 28.0 mm with a sampling interval of 1 μm/pixel.",

ABSTRACT = {A quanta image sensor (QIS) is a class of single-photon imaging devices that measure light intensity using oversampled binary observations. Because of the stochastic nature of the photon arrivals, data acquired by QIS is a massive stream of random binary bits. The goal of image reconstruction is to recover the underlying image from these bits. In this paper, we present a non-iterative image reconstruction algorithm for QIS. Unlike existing reconstruction methods that formulate the problem from an optimization perspective, the new algorithm directly recovers the images through a pair of nonlinear transformations and an off-the-shelf image denoising algorithm. By skipping the usual optimization procedure, we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in speed and even better image reconstruction quality. We validate the new algorithm on synthetic datasets, as well as real videos collected by one-bit single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) cameras.},
