\subsection{Light Propagation}

The electromagnetic radiance is expressed through the flow of minute particles, or quanta, named \textit{photons} in the context of light. The energy of a single photon, \begin{equation}W = h \cdot v \: \textup{[J]}\end{equation}
is a product of the frequency $v \:\textup{[Hz]}$, and the Planck constant $h = 6.62607015 \cdot 10^{-34} 
\:\textup{J\:s}$, valid for every harmonically oscillating system.


%\subsubsection{Quantum Fluctuations of Light}

Photons arriving at each pixel can be approximated by a Poisson  distribution function and arrive at random times. The rate of the photon arrivals, i.e. the distribution of the photons, is however still dictated by the local light intensity, as seen in Figure  \ref{fig:photon}. 

%$$\mathbb{P}\left\{B_{m}=1 ; s_{m}\right\}=\mathbb{P}\left\{Y_{m} \geq q ; s_{m}\right\}=\sum_{k=q}^{\infty} \frac{s_{m}^{k} e^{-s_{m}}}{k !}$$

\subsection{General Requirements in Gigapixel Applications}

Several general requirements must be met in gigapixel imaging devices. Since the higher information efficiency is desired in both scientific and consumer-grade applications (see Section \ref{chapter:motivation}), a high-resolution camera must not differ drastically from current implementations in its imaging capability.

For components which are primarily influenced by optoelectrics, \cite{GigaOptik} name following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a \textit{field of view} (FOV) of at least ca. 40$^\circ$, which is equivalent to the angle of view for humans at infinity focus ($\mathrm{FOV} = 2 \times \arctan\left(\frac{\text{sensor size}}{2{f}'}\right)$, ${f}' = 50m$m),
    \item an f-stop of ca. f/4-f/11 for operation under most common lighting conditions,
    \item and a lens design with low complexity to facilitate both portability and low manufacturing costs.
\end{itemize}
